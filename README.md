# Homework  - Explore Wikipedia's hyperlinks network?

*************************
### Goal
In this HM5 we analyze the Wikipedia's articles network by applying graph algorithms and try to answer some Research Questions.

### Get data to analyze
We rely on the dataset provided [here](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-topcats.html). For the purpose of our exploration, we do not consider the entire dataset. Instead, we focus on the articles belonging to a subset of categories.


## Files descriptions
The directory of this homework consists of one file:

1 `main.ipynb`
> This Jupyter notebook file contains all the functions and  the descriptive process in order to answer the questions and analyze the Graph.
